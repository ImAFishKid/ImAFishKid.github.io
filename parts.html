                <h6 class="main">Before you jump in and start buying parts, you should ask yourself: what am I going to use this PC for?</h6>
                <h6 class="sub">Are you going to use it for gaming? If so then you should put more budget into your GPU and sometimes CPU. 
                    Are you using it for video production? Then you shouldn't worry too much about GPU and focus on CPU and RAM. Or, are 
                    you using it for network storage? Then you should look for a motherboard with lots of I/O and a case with plenty of drive bays. <br>

                    For this website, however, I'll be focusing on the gaming side of things. So, another question to ask yourself is: What type of 
                    games am I going to be running? Are you into high-pace, millisecond-counts First Person Shooters? If so, then you'd want to allocate 
                    some budget into a good gaming mouse and keyboard, and a high refresh rate monitor, even if it comes at the cost of resolution or colour detail.
                    Or are you into RPGs and visually intensive games where you want to explore? Then you'll want a high resolution display, preferably with HDR. You 
                    may not care much about keyboards and mice and may even want a console controller instead. For your CPU, to future proof your build, a rule of thumb 
                    is to pick one with at least as many cores as a current-gen console and if you want to stream or record, you should add 2 or 4 more and make sure you 
                    get a gpu with a good hardware video encoder. <br>

                    Now, on to form factor, motherboards come in many different sizes, ATX is the biggest, with usually around 5 expansion slots, 3 M.2 slots, 6 SATA 
                    Headers and 4-8 RAM slots. ATX is good for those who want to maximise their build and don't mind about losing some desk space as a result. ATX cases 
                    are good for those who aren't sure what to get because they can fit any smaller motherboard size. Micro-ATX is the next size down, they usually have 
                    at most 4 expansion slots and 2-4 RAM slots with the same amount of SATA headers and M.2 slots as an ATX board. Now, the smallest, DTX and Mini-ITX 
                    are extremely small with 2 and 1 expansion slot(s) respectively, they are for those with a bit more experience so we won't cover them in this guide.
                    <br>
                    The next question is arguably your biggest: what's your budget? if you're thinking either less than you'd like or youll take what you can, then you 
                    should probably buy a used, prebuilt PC. They can be a fraction of the cost and can accommodate for the rest of your build fairly easily as most of 
                    the work has been done for you. Another option is buying older components which will be much cheaper as retailers clear stock to make way for new-gen 
                    parts.
                    <br>
                    When starting a build, you should look at your CPU and GPU first, as they take up most of the cost and will narrow down the list of extra components 
                    dramatically. For your CPU, it's important to see if downgrading slightly is better for your budget than the small amount of performance lost. Take 
                    the i9 11700k and i7 11700k, they're both 8 core, 16 thread processors but they have a max clock of 5.30GHz and 5.00GHz respectively. This means that 
                    in practicality, there's only a 6% performance difference between them with almost a NZD$300 difference in cost. There is more to a CPU than power, however, 
                    sometimes you'll want integrated graphics and sometimes youll want faster PCI-e lanes. For Intel CPUs you can go for a KF processor rather than a K series for 
                    a better price without integrated graphics. On the flip side, AMD CPUs are cheaper when buying with integrated graphics
