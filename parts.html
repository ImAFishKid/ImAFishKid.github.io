               Are you going to use it for gaming? If so then you should put more budget into your GPU and sometimes
               CPU.
               Are you using it for video production? Then you shouldn't worry too much about GPU and focus on CPU and
               RAM.
               Or, are you using it for network storage? Then you should look for a motherboard with lots of I/O and a
               case with
               plenty of drive bays. <br>

               For this website, however, I'll be focusing on the gaming side of things. So, another question to ask
               yourself is: What type of games am I going to be running? Are you into high-pace, millisecond-counts
               First Person Shooters? If so,
               then you'd want to allocate some budget into a good gaming mouse and keyboard, and a high refresh rate
               monitor, even if it comes at the
               cost of resolution or colour detail. Or are you into RPGs and visually intensive games where you want to
               explore? Then you'll want a high
               resolution display, preferably with HDR. You may not care much about keyboards and mice and may even want
               a console controller instead. For your CPU, to
               future proof your build, a rule of thumb is to pick one with at least as many cores as a current-gen
               console and if you want to stream or record, you
               should add 2 or 4 more and make sure you get a gpu with a good hardware video encoder.
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
               The next question is arguably your biggest: what's your budget? if you're thinking either less than you'd
               like or youll take what you can, then you should probably buy a used, prebuilt PC. They can be a fraction
               of the cost and can accommodate for the rest
               of your build fairly easily as most of the work has been done for you. Another option is buying older
               components which will be much cheaper as
               retailers clear stock to make way for new-gen parts. But, with that said, you should still make sure that
               your CPU socket and motherboard chipset are
               compatible before you buy. Also, be mindful that buying an older processor will make it harder to upgrade
               later down the line
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
               When starting a build, you should look at your CPU and GPU first, as they take up most of the cost and
               will narrow down the list of extra components
               dramatically. For your CPU, it's important to see if downgrading slightly is better for your budget than
               the small amount of performance lost. Take
               the i9 11700k and i7 11700k, they're both 8 core, 16 thread processors but they have a max clock of
               5.30GHz and 5.00GHz respectively. This means that
               in practicality, there's only a 6% performance difference between them with almost a NZD$300 difference
               in cost. There is more to a CPU than power,
               however, sometimes you'll want integrated graphics and sometimes youll want faster PCI-e lanes. For Intel
               CPUs you can go for a KF processor rather
               than a K series for better price without integrated graphics. On the flip side, AMD CPUs are cheaper when
               buying with integrated graphics.

               On to GPU, now, let's start by making something clear: do NOT buy a GPU based on clock speed alone.
               Always check reviews and look out for extra features
               that you want, like real-time raytracing, hardware video encoding and anything you think you'll likely
               use. Such as DLSS which boosts performance at a
               small cost of visual quality. Now, motherboards are an interesting one, because it can be enticing to go
               for one with all the big numbers but unless
               you're a hardcore overclocker who's getting your motherboards sponsored anyway, you're unlikely to see a
               huge performance boost. But, that's not to say
               you should go for the cheapest boards around, because although they may seem like a bargain, they can
               have limitations, like their max RAM and sometimes
               lack of overclocking support. For most people, a mid-range motherboard with good user reviews will do you
               just fine.

               Now, on to form factor, motherboards come in many different sizes, ATX is the biggest, with usually
               around 5
               expansion slots, 3 M.2 slots, 6 SATA Headers and 4-8 RAM slots. ATX is good for those who want to
               maximise their build and don't mind about
               losing some desk space as a result. ATX cases are good for those who aren't sure what to get because they
               can fit any smaller motherboard size. Micro-ATX
               is the next size down, they usually have at most 4 expansion slots and 2-4 RAM slots with the same amount
               of SATA headers and M.2 slots as an ATX
               board. Now, the smallest, DTX and Mini-ITX are extremely small with 2 and 1 expansion slot(s)
               respectively, however, they are for those with a bit more
               experience so we won't cover them in this guide.

               So, RAM, it can be either fairly straightforward or the complete opposite depending on who you ask.
               Usually, it's main labels are capacity (how much?),
               speed (how fast?) and timings (how often). A higher capacity generally means more simultaneous tasks but
               can put more strain on your CPU's memory controller
               which can mean lower frequency (speed) - which is how fast information can travel to and from the memory
               - and increased timings - which is how long the memory
               chips take to respond to a request. Noting, though, that there are sometimes diminishing returns on these
               features. Also that some CPU's "prefer" different
               frequencies because they can set their memory controllers to that frequency. For example, the Ryzen 3000
               and 5000 series CPU's which prefer frequencies of 3600 and 3800 MHz DDR4. There's lots more to RAM that 
               you can research yourself because otherwise this website would be more of a wall of text than it already is

               Storage is ususally divided into 2 categories: older SATA and newer PCI-E based NVME drives, both of which have 
               their own connections. Your motherboard manual will have a list of how many of each of these ports you have 
               which dictates how many drives you can have. HDDs or hard disk drives are used mostly in bulk storage - because 
               of their cheap price - and use a SATA interface. Solid State Drives or SSDs are more expensive but are reccomended 
               as a boot drive for your OS and for apps you use regularly due to a much higher performance. Some are still using 
               SATA interfaces but have mostly switched to NVME as of writing using the M.2 form factor. Remember form factor? it 
               just means size and shape.
