                    <h6 class="Overview">
                        Are you going to use it for gaming? If so then you should put more budget into your GPU and sometimes CPU. 
                        Are you using it for video production? Then you shouldn't worry too much about GPU and focus on CPU and RAM. Or, are 
                        you using it for network storage? Then you should look for a motherboard with lots of I/O and a case with plenty of drive bays. <br>
                        
                        For this website, however, I'll be focusing on the gaming side of things. So, another question to ask yourself is: What type of 
                        games am I going to be running? Are you into high-pace, millisecond-counts First Person Shooters? If so, then you'd want to allocate 
                        some budget into a good gaming mouse and keyboard, and a high refresh rate monitor, even if it comes at the cost of resolution or colour detail.
                        Or are you into RPGs and visually intensive games where you want to explore? Then you'll want a high resolution display, preferably with HDR. You 
                        may not care much about keyboards and mice and may even want a console controller instead. For your CPU, to future proof your build, a rule of thumb 
                        is to pick one with at least as many cores as a current-gen console and if you want to stream or record, you should add 2 or 4 more and make sure you 
                        get a gpu with a good hardware video encoder.

                    <h6 class="form-factor">
                        Now, on to form factor, motherboards come in many different sizes, ATX is the biggest, with usually around 5 expansion slots, 3 M.2 slots, 6 SATA 
                        Headers and 4-8 RAM slots. ATX is good for those who want to maximise their build and don't mind about losing some desk space as a result. ATX cases 
                        are good for those who aren't sure what to get because they can fit any smaller motherboard size. Micro-ATX is the next size down, they usually have 
                        at most 4 expansion slots and 2-4 RAM slots with the same amount of SATA headers and M.2 slots as an ATX board. Now, the smallest, DTX and Mini-ITX 
                        are extremely small with 2 and 1 expansion slot(s) respectively, they are for those with a bit more experience so we won't cover them in this guide.

                    <h6 class="budget"> 
                        The next question is arguably your biggest: what's your budget? if you're thinking either less than you'd like or youll take what you can, then you 
                        should probably buy a used, prebuilt PC. They can be a fraction of the cost and can accommodate for the rest of your build fairly easily as most of 
                        the work has been done for you. Another option is buying older components which will be much cheaper as retailers clear stock to make way for new-gen 
                        parts. But, with that said, you should still make sure that your CPU socket and motherboard chipset are compatible before you buy. Also, be mindful 
                        that buying an older processor will make it harder to upgrade later down the line
                    </h6>
                        
                    <h6 class="CPU">
                        When starting a build, you should look at your CPU and GPU first, as they take up most of the cost and will narrow down the list of extra components 
                        dramatically. For your CPU, it's important to see if downgrading slightly is better for your budget than the small amount of performance lost. Take 
                        the i9 11700k and i7 11700k, they're both 8 core, 16 thread processors but they have a max clock of 5.30GHz and 5.00GHz respectively. This means that 
                        in practicality, there's only a 6% performance difference between them with almost a NZD$300 difference in cost. There is more to a CPU than power, 
                        however, sometimes you'll want integrated graphics and sometimes youll want faster PCI-e lanes. For Intel CPUs you can go for a KF processor rather 
                        than a K series for  better price without integrated graphics. On the flip side, AMD CPUs are cheaper when buying with integrated graphics.

                    <h6 class="GPU">
                        On to GPU, now, let's start by making something clear: do NOT buy a GPU based on clock speed alone. Always check reviews and look out for extra features 
                        that you want, like real-time raytracing, hardware video encoding and anything you think you'll likely use. Such as DLSS which boosts performance at a 
                        small cost of visual quality. Now, motherboards are an interesting one, because it can be enticing to go for one with all the big numbers but unless 
                        you're a hardcore overclocker who's getting your motherboards sponsored anyway, you're unlikely to see a huge performance boost. But, that's not to say 
                        you should go for the cheapest boards around, because although they may seem like a bargain, they can have limitations, like their max RAM and sometimes 
                        lack of overclocking support. For most people, a mid-range motherboard with good user reviews will do you just fine.
