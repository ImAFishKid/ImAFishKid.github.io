                     for? </h3>

               Are you going to use it for gaming? If so then you should put more budget into your GPU and sometimes
               CPU.
               Are you using it for video production? Then you shouldn't worry too much about GPU and focus on CPU and
               RAM.
               Or, are you using it for network storage? Then you should look for a motherboard with lots of I/O and a
               case with
               plenty of drive bays. <br>

               For this website, however, I'll be focusing on the gaming side of things. So, another question to ask
               yourself is: What type of games am I going to be running? Are you into high-pace, millisecond-counts
               First Person Shooters? If so,
               then you'd want to allocate some budget into a good gaming mouse and keyboard, and a high refresh rate
               monitor, even if it comes at the
               cost of resolution or colour detail. Or are you into RPGs and visually intensive games where you want to
               explore? Then you'll want a high
               resolution display, preferably with HDR. You may not care much about keyboards and mice and may even want
               a console controller instead. For your CPU, to
               future proof your build, a rule of thumb is to pick one with at least as many cores as a current-gen
               console and if you want to stream or record, you
               should add 2 or 4 more and make sure you get a gpu with a good hardware video encoder.
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
               The next question is arguably your biggest: what's your budget? if you're thinking either less than you'd
               like or youll take what you can, then you should probably buy a used, prebuilt PC. They can be a fraction
               of the cost and can accommodate for the rest
               of your build fairly easily as most of the work has been done for you. Another option is buying older
               components which will be much cheaper as
               retailers clear stock to make way for new-gen parts. But, with that said, you should still make sure that
               your CPU socket and motherboard chipset are
               compatible before you buy. Also, be mindful that buying an older processor will make it harder to upgrade
               later down the line
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
               When starting a build, you should look at your CPU and GPU first, as they take up most of the cost and
               will narrow down the list of extra components
               dramatically. For your CPU, it's important to see if downgrading slightly is better for your budget than
               the small amount of performance lost. Take
               the i9 11700k and i7 11700k, they're both 8 core, 16 thread processors but they have a max clock of
               5.30GHz and 5.00GHz respectively. This means that
               in practicality, there's only a 6% performance difference between them with almost a NZD$300 difference
               in cost. There is more to a CPU than power,
               however, sometimes you'll want integrated graphics and sometimes youll want faster PCI-e lanes. For Intel
               CPUs you can go for a KF processor rather
               than a K series for better price without integrated graphics. On the flip side, AMD CPUs are cheaper when
               buying with integrated graphics.

            <div class="text-block">
               On to GPU, now, let's start by making something clear: do NOT buy a GPU based on clock speed alone.
               Always check reviews and look out for extra features
               that you want, like real-time raytracing, hardware video encoding and anything you think you'll likely
               use. Such as DLSS which boosts performance at a
               small cost of visual quality. Now, motherboards are an interesting one, because it can be enticing to go
               for one with all the big numbers but unless
               you're a hardcore overclocker who's getting your motherboards sponsored anyway, you're unlikely to see a
               huge performance boost. But, that's not to say
               you should go for the cheapest boards around, because although they may seem like a bargain, they can
               have limitations, like their max RAM and sometimes
               lack of overclocking support. For most people, a mid-range motherboard with good user reviews will do you
               just fine.

            <div class="text-block">
               Now, on to form factor, motherboards come in many different sizes, ATX is the biggest, with usually
               around 5
               expansion slots, 3 M.2 slots, 6 SATA Headers and 4-8 RAM slots. ATX is good for those who want to
               maximise their build and don't mind about
               losing some desk space as a result. ATX cases are good for those who aren't sure what to get because they
               can fit any smaller motherboard size. Micro-ATX
               is the next size down, they usually have at most 4 expansion slots and 2-4 RAM slots with the same amount
               of SATA headers and M.2 slots as an ATX
               board. Now, the smallest, DTX and Mini-ITX are extremely small with 2 and 1 expansion slot(s)
               respectively, however, they are for those with a bit more
               experience so we won't cover them in this guide.

               So, RAM, it can be either fairly straightforward or the complete opposite depending on who you ask.
               Usually, it's main labels are capacity (how much?), speed (how fast?) and timings (how often). A 
               higher capacity generally means more simultaneous tasks but can put more strain on your CPU's memory 
               controller which can mean lower frequency (speed) - which is how fast information can travel to and 
               from the memory - and increased timings - which is how long the memory chips take to respond to a 
               request. Noting, though, that there are sometimes diminishing returns on these features. Also that 
               some CPU's "prefer" different frequencies because they can set their memory controllers to that 
               frequency. For example, the Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series CPU's which prefer frequencies of 3600 and 
               3800 MHz DDR4. There's lots more to RAM that you can research yourself because otherwise this website 
               would be more of a wall of text than it already is.

               Storage is ususally divided into 2 categories: older SATA and newer PCI-E based NVME drives, both of which have 
               their own connections. Your motherboard manual will have a list of how many of each of these ports you have 
               which dictates how many drives you can have. HDDs or hard disk drives are used mostly in bulk storage - because 
               of their cheap price - and use a SATA interface. Solid State Drives or SSDs are more expensive but are recommended 
               as a boot drive for your OS and for apps you use regularly due to a much higher performance. Some are still using 
               SATA interfaces but have mostly switched to NVME as of writing using the M.2 form factor. Remember form factor? it 
               just means size and shape.

               Over to cooling, most PC building enthusiasts go for custom-loop liquid cooling and is usually the best without 
               going for below zero, which isn't sustainable. But, it is the best price/performance and definitely makes sense. 
               Liquid cooling would have its own section, but this guide is geting long enough already so I'll give a brief overview. 
               Your main concerns for liquid cooling are going to be the water block and overall surface area of your radiator setup,
               more fins on your water block and you'll get better CPU to liquid heat transfer and with more surface area on your 
               radiator and you'll get better cooling of the liquid. Materials are less intuitive, copper is the best conductor but 
               is more expensive than aluminium, with that said however, you should NOT mix and match different materials, galvanic 
               corrosion is terrible and the anti-corrosion mixtures do not work. Some metals work together, but don't do it unless 
               you know what you're doing. AIO coolers are a much better solution for most and a general rule is that a 240mm will 
               be fine for most CPUs. The downsides to AIO though, are that they can be much more expensive, less reliable and have 
               little performance benefits over a tower-style heatsinks which is why i recommend a large heatsink for easy, long term 
               operation. The drawbacks of this, though, are that it's much heavier and will be a bit of a hazard in transport, and 
               that some may hold the - *cough* incorrect *cough* - opinion that they don't look good.

            <div class="text-block">
               Ok, one thing you shouldn't cheap out on is your power supply. Early on, it was fairly easy to know a PSUs reliability 
               by looking at its 80+ rating, but it's so easy to hit those standards these days that it's not really a reliable measure. 
               Good news, however, is that Cybernetics Lab is putting together a better PSU standard for efficiency and noise level. Moving
               on, one of the main things you should think about is whether or not you want a modular interface, it does cost more but
               as connectivity standards evolve, it would mean that you would only need to buy a new cable rather than an adapter or 
               replacing your PSU. PSUs have become so reliable that I recommend not buying one unless it has at least 5 years warranty,
               with some being 12 years or over, they also, like motherboards and cases, have different form factors that you should check, 
               this is mostly important for smaller builds where SFX standard gives a smaller footprint to accommodate smaller builds. While 
               SFX defines a max depth that makes it look flat, SFX-L allows it to be wider for a square shape, and while it doesn't usually 
               have more connections, they're also more powerful than SFX standard and use bigger fans so can be quieter. There are a bunch 
               of other form factors, but for most builds you'll be fine with an ATX power supply, but do be aware that ATX PSUs don't list 
               their depth which you'll need to consider as it may not fit in your chosen case.
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
               Alright, cases, they range from $30-$50 on sale all the way up to over $2000 if you want the most unique build out there. We 
               already went over the different form factors but even with that in mind there's a huge amount of variety in cases. Because picking 
               a case can be incredibly personal, I'm just going to keep this one brief, unlike the last 2... I hope... First off the block, airflow, 
               no matter what type of build your're going for, be that ultra-quiet or high-cooling, you'll need airflow and there's nothing like a 
               mesh front panel. Ironically, they offer better sound than the closed front panel cases because the fans don't need to go as fast.
               Some people prefer the closed front aesthetic and some manufacturers have put fan spacing on the motherboard side panel so that it 
               looks good and keeps good airflow. Another thing to keep in mind is maintainence, if the airflow is amazing but cleaning sucks then
               it's gonna be a bad time, which is why removable dust filters and easily accessible front panels help hugely and most good cases 
               come equipped with these features. Expansion is fairly self explanatory, you'll want a case that has good cable management space and 
               space for what you want to do with it.
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-block">
               This one is going to be really long, and it's just about fans, so I'm going to split it into 2 parts. For your fans, you'll want to consider 
               both the fan diameter and the fan bearing type, if it's optimized for airflow or static pressure and whether it has addressable RGB. 
               Bearings let the fans spin freely, which means that the better the bearing, the more efficient and the less noisy your fans will be. 
               The three main types are sleeve bearings, which are cost effective and quiet, but wear out quite quickly as they rely on a lubricant 
               to keep them going. Higher quality sleeve bearing fans last much longer but the lubricant will expire, and as soon as it does, the fan
               goes with it. They're also made to run vertically to prevent the lubricant pooling, so they shouldn't be used on the top or bottom of 
               your case. Ball bearings are much more reliable, but are more expensive and are much louder because they use - as the name implies
                - physical ball bearings to negate friction instead of using lubricant. This does mean, however, that they're much more reliable at 
               higher temperatures than a sleeve fan. Fluid dynamic bearings, or hydrodynamic bearings, are much more advanced and serve as a midway 
               between sleeve and ball bearings. Their mechanism is similar to a sleeve fan but are filled with pressurised oil and better seals than 
               a regular lubricating grease. This does not mean that all fans that use this bearing are good, but Noctua use their own SSO bearings which 
               are hydrodynamic and extremely well known for their efficiency and quietness. There are many other types though, like maglev which are 
               hugely more expensive and don't have much RGB but are pretty much silent. Putting that aside, fans are put into 2 different categories:
               Airflow and static pressure with some designs that lean further one way than the other. For example, Corsair has an SP series which is 
               optimised for static pressure, the higher the static pressure, the more air is pushed through restrictive parts like a tight air filter, 
               radiator or heat sink. On the other side, we have ones that are optimised for pure airflow, once again serving as an example, Corsair's AF 
               series of fans are best in spots where there are no obstructions and the fan can push air freely.
            </div>

            <div class="text-block">
               To give you a break from the fans, lets talk hard drives (and RGB if we can squeeze it in). You may want them for a few reasons, like if you just want bulk storage or if you 
               want to give storage tiering a go. For whatever use case you may want, you'll need to pay attention to a few things: the RPM, cache size, 
               noise level and cost per GB. It used to be common just to grab a 7200RPM drive for better speed and lower response time, but it's starting
               to be costly since high capacity SSDs exist. High RPMs mean more noise and more heat, so before you go for the speediest drive around, you
               should make sure it's needed overall and when you do get one, make sure you check its operating temps to make sure it stays spinning for 
               as long as possible. For anyone else, 5600 and 5900RPM drives will suffice and should be much quieter and put out less heat.
               <br>
               <br>
               Alright, before we go and talk about fan sizes, lets talk RGB. You'll need to know what you're looking
