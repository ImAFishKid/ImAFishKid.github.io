                <h6 class="main">Before you jump in and start buying parts, you should ask yourself: what am I going to use this PC for?</h6>
                <h6 class="sub">Are you going to use it for gaming? If so then you should put more budget into your GPU and sometimes CPU. 
                    Are you using it for video production? Then you shouldn't worry too much about GPU and focus on CPU and RAM. Or, are 
                    you using it for network storage? Then you should look for a motherboard with lots of I/O and a case with plenty of drive bays. <br>

                    For this website, however, I'll be focusing on the gaming side of things. So, another question to ask yourself is: What type of 
                    games am I going to be running? Are you into high-pace, millisecond-counts First Person Shooters? If so, then you'd want to allocate 
                    some budget into a good gaming mouse and keyboard, and a high refresh rate monitor, even if it comes at the cost of resolution or colour detail.
                    Or are you into RPGs and visually intensive games where you want to explore? Then you'll want a high resolution display, preferably with HDR. You 
                    may not care much about keyboards and mice and may even want a console controller instead. For your CPU, to future proof your build, a rule of thumb 
                    is to pick one with at least as many cores as a current-gen console and if you want to stream or record, you should add 2 or 4 more and make sure you 
                    get a gpu with a good hardware video encoder. <br>

                    Now, on to form factor, motherboards come in many different sizes, ATX is the biggest, with usually around 5 expansion slots, 3 M.2 slots, 6 SATA 
                    Headers and 4-8 RAM slots. ATX is good for those who want to maximise their build and don't mind about losing some desk space as a result
